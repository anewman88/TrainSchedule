## Description
Homework Assignment 7 - Train Schedule
SMU Programming Bootcamp Spring 2019

The purpose of the program is a Train Scheduler program.  In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app accepts the following information from the user: Train Name, Train Destination, Start Time (military hh:mm). Then the app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date (the train schedule updates every minute) information about various trains: Train Name, Train Destination, Frequency, Next Arrival Time, and Minutes until next arrival. And finally, the app stores the appropriate information in a Firebase database.

If a train has not started service yet, the schedule will state that it is Not Online

## Installation
The program is started as a "normal" html file: html.index. No "installation" needed

## Project Status
Completed/Submitted for a grade
